      <div class='separator'>Our Customer</div>
      <p> Family members who have:  </p>
      <ul class="heartlist">
        <li>Have elders need to take pills frequently        </li>
        <li>Have elders with vision or hearing problems        </li>
        <li>Can't be around for the elders 24/7        </li>
        <li>Care a lot for their families       </li>
      </ul>

      <div class='separator'>Product Description </div>
      <p>Our product consists of a main device and several bottle caps. Family members can help the patients set up the alarm by recording their voices and replacing the bottle caps to our product bottle caps. They also need to set up the alarm time per day. </p>
      <p>During the time the user needs to take pills, the alarm will sound indicating which pills they need to take with the pre-recorded sounds from their family members/physicians. The user then can take the bottle next to our product device, if it's the correct one, the device will state that it's correct and the amount the user should take each time; if it's not, the reminder will ask the user to try another bottle. </p>
      <p>Pill Care also comes with a screen that can be attached to the Pill Care to display large font text for hearing-impaired elders. It also incorporates an app which sends notification to the user and the family whether pills need to be taken, and when the pills are taken by the patient. </p>

      <div class="separator">Laws of UI Design</div>
      <div>
        <h5> Millers Law</h5>
        <img class='img' src="images/UIlaw_millers.jpg">
        <div>Spotify ensures that the home page has the number of items/blocks of each its section being between 3-6. In this way, users like I feel that we are not overwhelmed with the options that we have while also have a sufficient number of choices to find our interests and preferences. Spotify hides other information (or more choices) into a "View more" option that can be expanded only if user chooses to.</div>
        <h5> Law of Pragnaz</h5>
        <img class='img' src="images/UIlaw_pragnaz.jpg">
        <div>Most phone UI design nowadays have its status bar at top consisting of multiple simple logos that can be interpreted by users. This gives users the room to imagine their representation. However the user will associate them to their actual representation, which are their simplest interpretation. For instance, people intrepret the five blocks in ascending order of their height as the signal strengh just as their distance to the signal tower. As another example, users interpret the lightning symbol as the lightning instead of two triangles or other symbols because it's the easiest to associate with lightning for charging.</div>
        <h5> Jacob's Law</h5>

        <div>The two search Engines Baidu and Google user interface look extremely similar in terms of their layout, button arrangement, and information display. This way when users use Baidu, the most popular search engine used by Chinese, they will have a very easy time to transition between these two different search engines.</div>
